Kubernetes Meetup Tokyo (hereafter referred to as the meetup) is a study event
and community for users of Kubernetes and Kubernetes related software to
exchange information and ideas. Though the meetup, it is our goal to provide a
space where Kubernetes users can meet with each other, exchange information and
ideas relevant to their specific fields, make friends, and increase business
activity.

In order to achieve this goal, we require all members of the community and
attees of meetup events to agree to the policy outlined in this document. In
order to maintain a safe environment, we request the cooperation of all
members.

Harassment includes but is not limited to the following:

- Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
  age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, religion
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking
- Following, harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Other forms of unwelcome targeted offensive verbal comments

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth
staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup staff immediately. If you cannot contact meetup staff in person, please send an email to [k8sjp-admin@googlegroups.com](<mailto:k8sjp-admin@googlegroups.com>).

Meeup staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at meetup and workshop venues and meetup-related social events.
